## Tests:
  ran npm test, ran node index.js to see if any code was broken and needed to be fixed

---

## Developement:
  
  When working on this challenge I found myself having to restart about 3 times and create an all new repo. I learned the importance of using node 16 for this challenge and also using the proper inquirer version. I used version 8.2.4 and I learned very quickly how important paying attention to the finite details was.
